# Richter-Tremolo
Richter is a tremolo plugin featuring four tempo sync-able LFOs, two of which modulate the signal directly, whilst the other two modulate the previous two LFOs

Richter can be found available for free download here: http://whiteelephantaudio.com/plugins/richter-tremolo/

Richter was originally written as an AudioUnit, and is now being rebuilt using the JUCE framework.
